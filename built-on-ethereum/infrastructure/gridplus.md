# Grid+

## Introduction

[Grid+](https://gridplus.io/) creates products that enable mainstream use of digital assets and cryptocurrencies. Their first major subsidiary is GridPlus Energy, a licensed Texas utility provider that uses advanced technology and innovative business practices to offer you dramatic savings in home energy - all powered by a simple mobile app.

Grid+ products form a new, fully integrated infrastructure stack for the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. [The Grid+ Lattice1](https://blog.gridplus.io/introducing-the-grid-lattice1-bc4ff6df5321) and Safe Cards use uncompromising security to enable the most secure cryptocurrency storage ever created. The Grid+ Pay mobile app and merchant tools allow users to easily spend their securely stored assets.

For GridPlus Energy customers, the Lattice1 connects to their electricity meter and automatically searches for the best wholesale rate then directly charges the customer the best rate plus a small fixed markup which creates huge savings versus traditional fixed rate plans.

GridPlus Energy creates additional savings through using short time interval automatic crypto payments to circumvent expensive legacy payment systems. This also saves money through diminishing the cost of bad debt expenses and collections (a major expense for traditional electricity retailers) and this is passed on to customers. At launch they will accept payment in ETH, DAI, BTC or via traditional credit card or ACH direct bank transfers.

To make this possible, a new type of crypto hardware infrastructure had to be designed from the ground up. The Lattice1 manages consumer energy needs but also facilitates many other use cases including finance and commerce. Whether you are a Grid+ retail electricity customer or not, this system provides security for and access to your cryptoassets and boasts features not found on other hardware wallets such as simplified account recovery via easy out of the box hardware [n-of-m multisig](https://blog.gridplus.io/2-of-3-blind-key-multi-signature-security-965e90640b4) and secure permissioned payments and subscriptions.

## The Company

Grid+ was founded in 2017 by Mark DAgostino, Alex Miller, and Dr. Karl Kreder and is based in Austin, Texas.

The GridPlus Energy subsidiary is the result of energy and technology research beginning in 2015 at ConsenSys including work done in conjunction with L03 on the Brooklyn Microgrid. Grid+ is the first major company to be incubated internally by ConsenSys as a main spoke and then spun out into its own venture. They are advised by Joseph Lubin, Ethereum cofounder and founder of ConsenSys.

Their products are proudly designed and engineered in Austin and assembled in the United States.

## Timeline

As of January 1, 2019, GridPlus Energy is live in the alpha stage and servicing 17 homes. In Q1 2019 they will begin the beta stage in which they will choose 300 new customers from the waiting list and begin testing the prototype hardware.

In Q2 2019 Grid+ will begin selling the Lattice1 hardware and Safe Cards worldwide.

## The Hardware

The Lattice1 is the cornerstone of the world’s first fully integrated system for securely storing and spending digital assets. At its core, the Lattice1 is a tamper resistant hardware wallet that links to your phone, your electricity meter, and other IoT devices using connectivity via Wifi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee antennas. The LDS mesh and other tamper resistance features essentially cause the unit to self destruct upon attempts to hack or reverse engineer the hardware.

The Lattice1 can be expanded to a limitless number of accounts using cheap [physically uncloneable Safe Cards](https://blog.gridplus.io/lattice1-safe-cards-75fbaa0dcf2e) which each have their own secure enclave chip and can be used for portable offline storage or hardware multisig. The Safe Cards’ physically uncloneable functions (PUFs) convert each chip’s unique electrical fingerprint into digital entropy that cannot be stolen or observed. The Lattice1 converts this entropy into a private key which cannot be hacked. Use this private key or restore another from a seed phrase to use as your digital wallet.

#### Lattice1 Features:
* 5” TFT Display with Multipoint Capacitive Touch Panel
* Card Slot for Safe Cards to Provide a Limitless Amount of Accounts and Options
* Lightbar Security Pattern for Notifications
* Capacitive Home Button
* Zigbee, Wifi, and Bluetooth Antennas
* Ethernet Jack
* Internal Secure Enclave (and External via Safe Cards)
* Secure Computing Environment
* LDS Tamper Detection Mesh
* Integrated PCD Security Mesh
* Compressed Elastomer Intrusion Detection
* Logic Power Isolation
* Lithium Ion Backup Battery

## Use Cases

#### Energy
The Lattice1 interfaces with your home's smart meter (which are already deployed across Texas) via Zigbee antenna. It looks up the best wholesale energy rates, automatically picks the best one, then directly charges you that plus a fixed markup creating huge savings for consumers. If you have a home battery or solar panels it manages these and sells to the grid at the optimal times or even earns money via automated energy arbitrage. All under the hood without having to do anything. This has the added benefit of smoothing out demand on the grid and making it more efficient. The Zigbee antenna also lets it control other home IoT devices like your Nest thermostat; automatic management of thermostats and other dispatchable loads makes your home more energy efficient and saves more money.

#### Mobile Payments
The Grid+Pay mobile app will feel familiar to users of the many popular crypto wallets that exist today, but delegates its security to the Lattice1. Stop tying the fate of your crypto assets to your phone and a seed phrase — easily pair the app with your Lattice1 device and start spending your crypto assets more securely. Using the Lattice1 you can authorize the mobile wallet to spend a specified amount of crypto per time period from cold storage without having to be physically in front of the Lattice1 to approve each transaction. 

#### Retail Point of Sale
Grid+Commerce lets you easily accept digital currencies with no fees and no chargebacks. Integrate the Grid+Pay components into your site with just a few lines of code and accept physical payments using a Lattice1 device as a payment terminal. Grid+ Pay provides merchants with an experience nearly identical to a traditional payment provider, but allows for direct peer-to-peer payments with their customers. Additionally, Grid+ is applying for PCI certification to allow the Lattice1 to accept traditional credit and debit card payments. Cutting out middlemen, businesses and consumers both save.

#### Generalized Crypto Hardware Platform
The Lattice1 SDK has been feature-locked and is functionally ready for production pending the release of the hardware itself. Multiple teams are working behind the scenes to integrate the hardware into their own platforms. You can [read the documentation here](https://gridplus-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest) and [check out the source code here.](https://github.com/GridPlus/gridplus-sdk) It is important to note that Grid+ will be evaluating additional signature schemas for future releases. Examples may include ERC721 transfers, Lightning transactions, or Maker CDP interactions. If you are a developer utilizing a signature schema outside of ether, ERC20, and bitcoin transfers (and if you want to integrate with the Lattice1), please reach out to the team and they may add the schema to a future firmware update.

## The Token
GRID can be redeemed for 500 kWh of electricity with zero markup by Grid+. A fixed number have been created and when redeemed by a customer, they are destroyed forever. Retail customers can buy these on the secondary market to redeem them for even more savings on their electricity bills.

At launch you will be able to use GRID for a discount on the Lattice1 hardware; details will be available once presales open.

Once a GRID token is used it is taken out of circulation forever. You can track how many GRID have been redeemed so far on the [token page of the official Grid+ website.](https://gridplus.io/grid-token)
